## Overview
Welcome to the Realtime Digital Filter Design application! a sophisticated desktop tool designed for engineers, researchers, and enthusiasts alike. Unleash the power of digital signal processing with our intuitive interface and comprehensive feature set, allowing you to craft custom digital filters effortlessly and achieve precise control over your signal processing tasks by placing zeros and poles on the z-plane and visualizing the filter's frequency response and apply it to real-time signals.

## Features
- **Interactive Z-Plane Visualization**: Effortlessly place zeros and poles on the z-plane with our intuitive graphical interface, enabling seamless customization and manipulation.

- **Comprehensive Frequency Response Analysis**: Gain deep insights into your filter's behavior with detailed magnitude and phase response graphs, empowering you to fine-tune your designs for optimal performance.

- **Real-time Signal Processing**: Apply your designed filter to lengthy signals in real-time, with adjustable filtering speeds for dynamic control over your signal processing pipelines.

- **Dynamic Input Signal Generation**: Generate input signals in real-time by simply moving your mouse, adjusting frequency based on movement speed, facilitating intuitive experimentation and analysis.

- **Effortless Phase Correction**: Address phase issues with ease using built-in All-Pass filters, providing convenient options from our library or the ability to craft custom solutions tailored to your specific requirements.
